# tomcat sessions                                                  

#### This project shows how to configure a simple servlet to run on Tomcat in Kubernetes with distributed session replication.

###### There are two tested configurations:
 - [conf/server.kubernetes.xml](conf/server.kubernetes.xml)
  
This is a basic cluster configuration that leverages the Tomcat cluster membership implementation that gets membership information from the Kubernetes API.


 - [conf/server.kubernetes.async.xml](conf/server.kubernetes.async.xml)

This is a configuation that distributes state using the Tomcat pooled parallel asynchronous sender.


#### Running ***make*** will list build targets

- DOCKER_REGISTRY 

Define environment variable $DOCKER_REGISTRY for the container registry used.

###### testing tools

- [cli.newsession](cli.newsession)
  
This calls the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to create a new session

- [cli](cli)

After a session is created, this call the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to continue to use the session created previously.
