To configure session replication for Apache Tomcat using Redis, follow these steps:

1. Download the Redis client for Java, such as Jedis or Lettuce, and include it in your Tomcat project's classpath.

2. Configure your Tomcat server to use Redis as a session manager. To do this, open the `context.xml` file in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation and add the following lines:

```
<Valve className="com.orangefunction.tomcat.redissessions.RedisSessionHandlerValve" />
<Manager className="com.orangefunction.tomcat.redissessions.RedisSessionManager"
        host="localhost"
        port="6379"
        database="0"
        maxInactiveInterval="60" />
```

This configures Tomcat to use Redis as a session manager, with a default maximum inactive interval of 60 minutes. Replace `localhost` and `6379` with the hostname and port of your Redis server, and adjust the other parameters as necessary.

3. Test your configuration by starting Tomcat and verifying that session data is being stored in Redis. You can do this by connecting to the Redis server with a client such as `redis-cli` and running the `keys *` command to list all keys in the default database.

That's it! With these steps, you've configured Tomcat to use Redis for session replication.
